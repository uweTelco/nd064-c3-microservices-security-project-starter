To effectively test Kubernetes security hardening changes while ensuring system stability, this test plan emphasizes validation techniques and risk mitigation strategies:

Testing Methodology

Staging Environment Validation

Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform to replicate production configurations and create identical staging clusters.
Apply hardening changes to the staging environment first, then conduct:
Automated security scans with tools like Kube-bench (for CIS benchmarks) and Kubesec (for manifest analysis).
Load testing to mimic production traffic patterns and identify any performance regressions.
Penetration testing to simulate attack vectors targeting Kubernetes API endpoints and container runtime.
Progressive Exposure Strategy

Utilize canary deployments for hardening changes with a strategy:
strategy:
type: RollingUpdate
rollingUpdate:
maxSurge: 25%
maxUnavailable: 25%
Monitor canary nodes for over 72 hours before proceeding with a full rollout.
Stability Assurance

Availability Safeguards

Implement PodDisruptionBudgets to ensure minimum available instances during updates:
apiVersion: policy/v1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
spec:
minAvailable: 60%
selector:
matchLabels:
app: critical-service
Configure liveness/readiness probes with conservative thresholds to prevent premature termination of stabilized workloads.
Continuous Observability

Deploy a monitoring stack (Prometheus/Grafana) to track:
Health of control plane components (API server latency, etcd write speeds).
Node resource saturation metrics (CPU steal time, memory pressure).
Network policy effectiveness via flow logs.
Establish baseline metrics from production and set alerts for deviations of Â±15% in staging.
Rollback Protocol

Keep version-controlled backups of cluster state using Velero.
Test rollback procedures in staging, measuring recovery time objectives (RTO) for critical workloads.
This approach balances security validation with operational safety through mirrored environments, phased exposure, and real-time telemetry. By combining automated checks with human verification checkpoints, teams can confidently implement hardening changes while meeting availability SLAs.
